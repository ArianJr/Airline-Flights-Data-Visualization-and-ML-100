# ✈️ Airline Flights Data Analysis & Machine Learning

This project explores U.S. airline flight data through interactive visualizations and predictive modeling. It aims to uncover patterns in delays and cancellations and build machine learning models to forecast flight outcomes.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Kaggle - Airline Flight Data: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data)
- **Size**: ~600,000 flight records
- **Features**: Includes airline, origin/destination, departure/arrival times, delay durations, cancellation reasons, and more.

---

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering (e.g., delay categories, time bins)
   - Encoding categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing delay patterns by airline, airport, and time of day
   - Analyzing cancellation trends and seasonal effects

3. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Key factors influencing delays and cancellations
   - Suggestions for improving airline operations

## 🧠 Key Findings

- Flights departing in the evening are more prone to delays.
- Weather-related cancellations spike during winter months.
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression with ~85% accuracy.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
